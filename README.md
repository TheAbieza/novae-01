## General Info

This is the first project I made before I got into vocational high school and took software engineering as my major. It's a short retro-style shoot 'em' up (shmup) game about a spaceship (player) and aliens (enemies). This project is currently abandoned. I have left it dusted in my folder for years lol. I'm planning to continue the development since I already have some assets for it. Unfortunately, school was busy, and I had to focus on other stuff like web and app development.
